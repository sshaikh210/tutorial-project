Greetings Hamza,

Thug Coding (www.thugcoding.com) will be similar to Code Academy in the sense that we will post exercises for users trying to learn how to code. 

We will begin with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercises. The difference between us (thugcoding) and the rest of the coding tutorials is we will use a language the common man can understand (and laugh at) we will speak like thugs (American gangsters). 

Similar to Thug Kitchen - they provide serious content, in a humorous presentation. 

Basic functions - 

- Ace Code Editor to process code
- Ability to process code and display output
- Ability to check if correct input has been submitted
- Ability to move on to next exercise
